## Why
I wanted to make this script for personnal purpose and to develop my skills in Python. Having a YouTube downloader is very useful and trustful because you built it on your own and everything is open source. So no need to check if the files are safe or not. The adventage of having your own YouTube downloader is that you can fit it to your needs.
## How
For making this project this is project I simply used [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) who's doing almost the entire of the job. It's an amzing open source library that have powerful capabilities to manage YouTube streams and all other kind of things related to YouTubbe videos. All I needed to do was to make a script to interact with this powerful library.
